Behind the research is an initiave I created for the University of Bath maths department, in an effort to increase higher education applications. The idea being to demystify academia by showcasing the unconventional career paths that exist, and turn the idea of  academics from mysterious people who hide in rooms with blackboards, to real people with hobbies, passions, and flaws. 

Furthermore Behind the Research acts as a training centre for the departments current PhD students. As they strive to create this portfolio of content they learn key communication skills.
