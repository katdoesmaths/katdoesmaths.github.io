Hi and Shwmae, Welcome and Croeso. My name is Kat, and I do maths. Specifically, I have a PhD in Statistical Applied Mathematics, but I consider myself a fluid dynamicist at heart as that is where my main research interests lie. I enjoy sharing my passion for maths with others, and encouraging people to get past the stigma that often comes with telling people you like maths. I also have a strong passion for demystifying academia, and easing access to higher education, through sharing educational content, and providing information around higher education admissions. 
I describe myself as a wearer of many hats, as having to put a name to the numerous roles I have has become too complicated (and if kat does maths didn't give it away, I like easy explanations). Some of the hats I wear currently are: 
* Innovation Research Associate (InRA) at the [Centre for Applications of Mathematical & Computing Sciences (CAMaCS)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/camacs/)
* Twitch Livestreamer
* Maths Communicator, and speaker for Education in Action
* Outreach and academic communication trainer 
* Co-Creator and Lead on PhD Your Way 
* Engagement officer for the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) Early Career Committee

I GOT MY PHD!!!!!! Whilst I've been finishing up my studies, my online presence has had to take a bit of a backseat. With a new job and a brand new lease on life, I'm hoping to get back to livestreaming early this autumn! <i>- last updated on 30/08/2024</i>
