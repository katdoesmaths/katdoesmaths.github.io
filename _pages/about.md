Hi and Shwmae, Welcome and Croeso. My name is Kat, and I do maths. Specifically, I have a PhD in Statistical Applied Mathematics, but I consider myself a fluid dynamicist at heart as that is where my main research interests lie. I enjoy sharing my passion for maths with others, and encouraging people to get past the stigma that often comes with telling people you like maths. I also have a strong passion for demystifying academia, and easing access to higher education, through sharing educational content and providing information around higher education admissions. 

I describe myself as a wearer of many hats, as having to put a name to the numerous roles I have has become too complicated (and if kat does maths didn't give it away, I like easy explanations). Some of the hats I wear currently are: 
* Innovation Research Associate (InRA) at the [Centre for Applications of Mathematical & Computing Sciences (CAMaCS)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/camacs/)
* Twitch Livestreamer
* Maths Communicator, and speaker for Education in Action
* Outreach and academic communication trainer 
* Co-Creator and Lead on [PhD Your Way](https://sites.google.com/view/phd-your-way) 
* Engagement leader for the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) [Early Career Committee](https://ima.org.uk/roles/early-career-mathematicians-committee/)
