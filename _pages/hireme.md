 I am currently available from Feb 2026 onwards, for fees and booking please reach out at katdoesenquiries(at)gmail.com.



Speaking 
----- 

I am available for a variety of speaking and hosting engagements. I bring an informal, energetic approach to mathematics, and am more than comfortable working with audiences who would consider themselves reluctant mathematicians.

* **Popular Science talks** (16+) <br>
    I'm happy to create custom talks for an increased fee, however my current roster inlcudes:
    * Everyday fluid dynamics 
    * From symphony to the sea 
    * Circles, and Gauss, and squares, oh Ï€! 
    * A mathematician walks into a bar...
    * Prime suspects 

* **Hosting and Presenting** <br>
    I'm available to host or present at events, panels, and conferences.  My experience ranges from compering academic conferences, Science Youtube Conventions, hosting Icebreaker events, and chairing panel discussions to name a few. I bring energy, humour, and a relaxed style that keeps things flowing while making audiences feel welcome and engaged. Whether you're looking for a high energy entertainer, or a professional mathematician to bring the numbers, please do get in touch. 


Training 
---

I have over five years of experience delivering training to PhD students and early career researchers helping give them the skills to develop their own communication techniques and online presences. I offer a series of modules which fit into three streams of bespoke training sessions and which can be tailored to a 1 hour talk, or half-day/full-day workshops.


1.  **How I learned to Stop Worrying and love the 'Comm** <br>
    A tell-all walk through my own experience of discovering maths communication, building up public speaking skills and everything you need to kick start your own communication journey. _This session has the option to be tailored as a workshop lead up for a specific event._ <br>
    > e.g. 1 hour talk: Finding your niche.
2. **Online Presence for Academics**<br>
    Whether you're event planning, wanting to improve your own personal brand and online presence, or curious how to elevate your hybrid events, this hands-on workshop takes you through step by step the best way to get comfortable online. _laptops/ PC access required_. <br>
    > e.g half day: Building a brand, developing a website, and OBS and other Software.
3. **Conferencing 101** <br>
     This series is ideal for early year PhD students and late stage undergraduates who don't know where to start with conferences. Starting from why you attend a conference, developing poster/talk presentation skills, and key networking tips and tricks that can elevate your conferencing game. _This can also be tailored to helping ECR researchers interested in running their own conference, and combined with modules from Online Presence for running hybrid events._ <br>
     > e.g full day: Morning session consulting with conference organisers covering programming and logistics, engagement evaluation, hybrid events. Afternoon session for attendees including public speaking, poster design, creating an elevator pitch.

_Introduction to (Maths/Science) Communication, Fitting to your format, Finding your niche, Adapt to your Audience, Storytelling for academics, Engagement evaluation, Introduction to Online Engagement, Creating an elevator pitch, Website Creation, Social Media for academics, Creating and running hybrid and online events, Getting the most out of hybrid and online events, OBS and other software, Poster design, Presentation design, Public Speaking , Building Stage Presence._

Throughout my PhD at the SAMBa CDT, University of Bath, we were encouraged to collaborate with each other extensively, and aid the training for the newer cohorts of students. Through this I developed a series of training courses perfect for PhD students and Early Career Researchers, and coupled it with my MathsComm career to develop training sessions for broader maths communication for academic audiences. 

I currently offer three streams of training, each of which can be tailored to 1hr talks, or half/full day training. Below are the streams and examples of the modules within each area. 

* How I learned to stop worrying and love the 'Comm
    * Introduction to (Maths/Science) Communication
    * Refining your material
