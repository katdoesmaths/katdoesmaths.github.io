As of Autumn 2023 I'm delighted to be a rostered speaker for <a hdref="https://educationinaction.org.uk/">Education in Action</a> and have spoken at their Physics in Action and Maths in Action events. 

I am happy to create custom talks for an increased fee, but my talks currently on roster include: 
* Every day fluid dynamics (16+)
* From Symphony to the sea (16+) 
* Circles, and Gauss, and Squares, Oh my!  (16+)
* The Maths of Music (12+)


Training

Throughout my PhD at the SAMBa CDT, University of Bath, we were encouraged to collaborate with eachother extensively, and aid the training for the newer cohorts of students. Through this I developed a series of training courses perfect for PhD students, and coupled my SciComm career to develop training sessions for broader maths communication for academic audiences. 

I currently offer three streams of training, each of which can be tailored to 1hr talks, or half/full day training. Below are the streams and example content. 

* How I learned to stop worrying and love the 'Comm
    * Introduction to (Maths/Science) Communication
    * Refining material
    * Storytelling for academics
    * Engagement evaluation
    * Planning engagement activities
    * Audience consideration
    * Online engagement
    * Creating an elevator pitch 


* Online presences for academics
    * Website Creation 
    * Social Media for academics
    * Creating and running hybrid and online events 
    * Getting the most out of hybrid and online events
