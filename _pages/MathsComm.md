Livestreaming
----

In May 2021, I started streaming on Twitch, and as such my channel <a href="https://twitch.tv/KatDoesMaths">KatDoesMaths</a> was born. Twitch is a platform that allows people to livestream to a public audience with an interactive chat function. Typically the platform is used for streaming games, but more and more people are finding ingeneous new ways to utilise the platform. As such there is an ever growing community of Science Communicators on the platform. Personally I use the platform to showcase my life as a PhD student, practise my outreach talks and get people passionate about mathematics. It is content that is unedited, authentic and allows a question and answer style interaction between myself and the audience. 

I currently aim to stream at least three times a week, but would love to be able to increase that number. At the minute I have three main types of streams: 
<ul>
    <li> Pomodoro Co-working Streams - these are some of my favourite (not just because they're the most productive). During these streams I will usually share what I'm working on in the PhD at the minute, allowing people to ask questions and see what the day-to-day life of a PhD student actually looks like. </li>
    <li> Office Hours - These streams I've been using to work on science communication by mixing between going through exam papers, and having outreach talks. Currently wee've been looking at the summer 2019 A Level WJEC syllabus, and have completed all Unit 1-4 past papers on stream. I am currently moving on to a series of streams focused on topics of maths that are based around A level difficulty.  </li>
    <li> Puzzle Games - Okay so these ones are definitely more similar to the typical content on twitch, but I can't say no to the occasional video game so why not make it educational, everybody loves a good puzzle!</li>
</ul>



Public Speaking & Outreach

<br />
&nbsp;First trained as a <a href="https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors">STEM Ambassador</a> in 2017, I have been taking part in outreach events since my undergraduate days, supporting festivals, leading workshops in schools, and more recently presenting to larger audiences. Events I've supported include <a href="https://museum.wales/cardiff/whatson/10492/Brain-Games/">Brain Games 2017</a>, <a href="https://mathsinspiration.com/">Maths Inspiration 2019</a>. In Spring 2022 I gave my first Royal Institution Maths Masterclass (shown on the right) alongside my fellow PhD students at the University of Bath. As of Autumn 2023 I'm delighted to be a rostered speaker for <a hdref="https://educationinaction.org.uk/">Education in Action</a> and have spoken at their Physics in Action days, which consisted of speaking infront of hundres of A level Physics students.

&nbsp; I created  the <a href="https://behindtheresearch.github.io">Behind the Research</a> project nad successfully lead it during my final years at the Unversity of Bath. This initiative is a group of PhD students trying to showcase the real day to day life of academic research, through livestreams, videos and social media we hope to de-mystify maths at the PhD level and show the variety of life that research can give. 
<br />

&nbsp; I also helped create, and now lead <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/phd-your-way">PhD Your Way</a>, an annual  online event for final year undergraduates, and masters students, focused on informing them of the variety of maths PhD opportunities in the UK. This event was  co-founded by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/patricknairne/">Patrick Nairne</a>, and a collaboration of academics from multiple different universities. Our first event hosted 15 universities, and our second successfully ran with 23 different universities in atttendance. 
<br />

&nbsp;I am happy to create custom talks for an increased fee, but my talks currently on roster include: 
* Every day fluid dynamics (16+)
* From Symphony to the sea (16+) 
* The Maths of Music (12+)


Training
---
Throughout my PhD at the SAMBa CDT, University of Bath, we were encouraged to collaborate with eachother extensively, and aid the training for the newer cohorts of students. Through this I developed a series of training courses perfect for PhD students, and coupled my SciComm career to develop training sessions for broader maths communication for academic audiences. The sessions I currently offer include: 
* How I learned to stop worrying and love the 'Comm (Getting started with Maths Communication) 
* Websites and Online presence for academics 
* Poster design for academic conferences
* Speaking at academic conferences
