Livestreaming
----
 
You can find me on twitch as [KatDoesMaths](https://twitch.tv/katdoesmaths), where I typically do three kinds of streams: 
<ul>
    <li> Pomodoro Co-working Streams - these are some of my favourite (not just because they're the most productive). During these streams I will usually share what I'm working on with research at the minute, allowing people to ask questions and see what the day-to-day life of a PhD student actually looks like. </li>
    <li> Office Hours - We go through maths problems, either exam style questions or working on lecture content. They are fun and educational sessions which are generally focused on post 16 content, but we're always able to chat through earlier stuff.  </li>
    <li> Puzzle Games - Okay so these ones are definitely more similar to the typical content on twitch, but I can't say no to the occasional video game so why not make it educational, everybody loves a good puzzle!</li>
</ul>

Maths and Art 
----

As part of my work with CAMaCS I am collaborating with  <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/montenegro-johnson/">Professor Tom Montenegro-Johnson</a> and team, and Paper artist <a href="https://cocosato.co.uk/">Coco Sato</a>, to find new and unique ways of visualising research. This work is completed as part of the 'Shape Transforming Active Microfluidics' project funded by <a href="https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/">Leverhulme Trust</a>.

Public Speaking & Outreach
----

I first trained as a <a href="https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors">STEM Ambassador</a> in 2017, and have been taking part in outreach events since my undergraduate days; supporting festivals, leading workshops in schools, and more recently presenting to larger audiences. Events I've supported include <a href="https://museum.wales/cardiff/whatson/10492/Brain-Games/">Brain Games 2017</a>, <a href="https://mathsinspiration.com/">Maths Inspiration 2019</a>, and Royal Institution Maths Masterclasses in 2022. I'm also a speaker at <a href="https://pintofscience.co.uk/">Pint of Science</a>.
