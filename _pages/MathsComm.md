Livestreaming
----
 
You can find me on twitch as [KatDoesMaths](https://twitch.tv/katdoesmaths), where I do three kinds of streams: 
<ul>
    <li> Pomodoro Co-working Streams - these are some of my favourite (not just because they're the most productive). During these streams I will usually share what I'm working on with research at the minute, allowing people to ask questions and see what the day-to-day life of a PhD student actually looks like. </li>
    <li> Office Hours - We go through maths problems, either exam style questions or working on lecture content. They are fun and educational sessions which are generally focused on post 16 content, but we're always able to chat through earlier stuff.  </li>
    <li> Puzzle Games - Okay so these ones are definitely more similar to the typical content on twitch, but I can't say no to the occasional video game so why not make it educational, everybody loves a good puzzle!</li>
</ul>



Public Speaking & Outreach
----

I first trained as a <a href="https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors">STEM Ambassador</a> in 2017, and have been taking part in outreach events since my undergraduate days; supporting festivals, leading workshops in schools, and more recently presenting to larger audiences. Events I've supported include <a href="https://museum.wales/cardiff/whatson/10492/Brain-Games/">Brain Games 2017</a>, <a href="https://mathsinspiration.com/">Maths Inspiration 2019</a>, and Royal Institution Maths Masterclasses in 2022.  As of Autumn 2023 I'm delighted to be a rostered speaker for <a hdref="https://educationinaction.org.uk/">Education in Action</a> and have spoken at their Physics in Action and Maths in Action events. 

I am happy to create custom talks for an increased fee, but my talks currently on roster include: 
* Every day fluid dynamics (16+)
* From Symphony to the sea (16+) 
* Circles, and Gauss, and Squares, Oh my!  (16+)
* The Maths of Music (12+)


Training
---
Throughout my PhD at the SAMBa CDT, University of Bath, we were encouraged to collaborate with eachother extensively, and aid the training for the newer cohorts of students. Through this I developed a series of training courses perfect for PhD students, and coupled my SciComm career to develop training sessions for broader maths communication for academic audiences. The sessions I currently offer include: 
* How I learned to stop worrying and love the 'Comm (Getting started with Maths Communication) 
* Websites and Online presence for academics 
* Poster design for academics
* Speaking at academic conferences
* How to run hybrid events
* Developing communication opportunities in your department - Consultancy
