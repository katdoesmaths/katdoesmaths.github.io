Outside of my PhD research I spend my time doing maths communication under the name “KatDoesMaths”, and what better way to describe this talk. It’ll be broken down into three sections: The first “Kat”, I’ll talk you through my journey to get to where I am. “Does” is where I want to share with you all the tips and tricks of the Maths Communication trade that I’ve picked up over the years, and how to get started if you’re thinking about getting into outreach. And then finally I’m going to actually communicate some “Maths” with you. It’s a bold statement to talk about my ability to communicate maths and then follow it up with a research talk, but I’m excited to share with you my work (and there are some pretty pictures at the end!). Away from the glitz and glam of Maths Communication, I study fluid dynamics. In order for a droplet to rebound from a liquid surface there needs to be an air layer keeping the two liquids separate, else the droplet will coalesce. My research is investigating the dynamics of this air layer, and I will introduce my numerical model which is able to recreate this system.
